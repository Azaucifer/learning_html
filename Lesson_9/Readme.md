# ü™ü HTML Table Example

This project contains a basic HTML webpage that demonstrates the use of tables to display data. It showcases a list of Conor McGregor's fights, including event details, opponents, venues, cities, and Pay-Per-View (PPV) sales. This example is designed to help learners understand how to create and structure tables in HTML.

## üìú Code Overview
The HTML file includes the following sections:

- **DOCTYPE Declaration**: `<!DOCTYPE html>` specifies that this is an HTML5 document.
- **HTML Element**: `<html lang="en">` wraps all the content and sets the language to English.

### üò∏ Head Section
The `<head>` section contains metadata, viewport settings, and the title of the page:

- **Charset**: `<meta charset="UTF-8">` sets the character encoding to UTF-8 for proper text display.
- **Viewport**: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` ensures the webpage is responsive by setting the viewport width to the device width and initial scale to 1.
- **Title**: `<title>HTML Table</title>` sets the browser tab title.

### üí™ Body Section
The `<body>` section displays the visible content of the webpage:

- **Heading**: `<h1>Conor McGregor Fights</h1>`: A level 1 heading for the section showcasing Conor McGregor's fights.
- **Table**:
  - `<table>`: The table element that contains all the tabular data.
    - **Table Head**:
      - `<thead>`: The header section of the table.
        - `<tr>`: A table row.
          - `<th>Event</th>`: A table header cell for the event.

          - `<th>City</th>`: A table header cell for the city.
          - `<th>PPV</th>`: A table header cell for the Pay-Per-View sales.
    - **Table Body**:
      - `<tbody>`: The body section of the table containing the actual data.
        - `<tr>`: A table row.
          - `<td>UFC 189</td>`: A table data cell for the event.
          - `<td>Mendes vs McGregor</td>`: A table data cell for the fight.
          - `<td rowspan="3">MGM Grand</td>`: A table data cell for the venue, spanning three rows.
          - `<td rowspan="4">Las Vegas</td>`: A table data cell for the city, spanning four rows.
          - `<td>825,000</td>`: A table data cell for the PPV sales.
        - (Additional rows follow the same structure.)
    - **Table Foot**:
      - `<tfoot>`: The footer section of the table.
        - `<tr>`: A table row.
          - `<td colspan="4">Total Sales</td>`: A table data cell for the total sales, spanning four columns.
          - `<td>4,992,000</td>`: A table data cell for the total PPV sales.
