# ðŸ–¥A WebPage

This project contains a basic HTML webpage that demonstrates foundational HTML and CSS concepts. The webpage displays a "Hello World!" message with custom styling, making it an ideal starting point for learning HTML and CSS basics.

## ðŸ“œCode Overview

The HTML file includes the following sections:

- **DOCTYPE Declaration**: `<!DOCTYPE html>` specifies that this is an HTML5 document.
- **HTML Element**: `<html lang="en">` wraps all the content and sets the language to English.

### ðŸ§ Head Section

The `<head>` section contains metadata, page styling, and a favicon:
  - **Charset**: `<meta charset="UTF-8">` sets the character encoding to UTF-8 for proper text display.
  - **Author**: `<meta name="author" content="Shams">` designates the author of the page.
  - **Description**: `<meta name="description" content="This page contains all things I am learning how to create on HTML">` provides a summary of the page content.
  - **Title**: `<title>My First WebPage</title>` sets the browser tab title.
  - **Favicon**: `<link rel="icon" href="html5.png" type="image/x-icon">` links an icon (`html5.png`) to be used as the pageâ€™s favicon.
  - **Internal CSS**: A `<style>` tag is used for inline CSS, applying custom styles to the HTML and body elements.

    - **Font Size**: `html { font-size: 22px; }` sets the base font size.
    - **Body Background Color**: `body { background-color: #333; }` sets the background to dark gray.
    - **Text Color**: `color: whitesmoke;` makes text appear in a soft white color for contrast.

### ðŸ’ªBody Section

The `<body>` section displays the visible content of the webpage:
  - **Heading**: `<h1>Hello World!</h1>` is the main heading of the page.
  - **Paragraph**: `<p>This is my first webpage.</p>` provides an introductory message.

1. Clone or download this HTML file to your local machine.
2. Place an image named `html5.png` in the same directory to display the favicon.
3. Open the HTML file in any web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) to view the webpage.
