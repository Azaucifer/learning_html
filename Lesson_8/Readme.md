# ⏹ HTML Div Elements Example

This project contains a basic HTML webpage that demonstrates the use of `div` elements to separate and group inline elements. It is designed to help learners understand how to structure and organize content using the `div` element in HTML.

## 📜 Code Overview
The HTML file includes the following sections:

- **DOCTYPE Declaration**: `<!DOCTYPE html>` specifies that this is an HTML5 document.
- **HTML Element**: `<html lang="en">` wraps all the content and sets the language to English.

### 😸 Head Section
The `<head>` section contains metadata, viewport settings, and the title of the page:

- **Charset**: `<meta charset="UTF-8">` sets the character encoding to UTF-8 for proper text display.
- **Viewport**: `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` ensures the webpage is responsive by setting the viewport width to the device width and initial scale to 1.
- **Title**: `<title>div</title>` sets the browser tab title.

### 💪 Body Section
The `<body>` section displays the visible content of the webpage:

- **Heading**: `<h1>Web Links</h1>`: A level 1 heading for the web links section.
- **Paragraph**: `<p>This shows how a div (Block element) separates inline elements</p>`: A paragraph explaining the purpose of the example.
- **Div Elements and Links**:
  - `<div>`: A block-level container for grouping elements.
    - `<a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>`: A hyperlink to Google.
    - `<a href="http://www.wikipedia.com">Wikipedia</a>`: A hyperlink to Wikipedia.
  - `<div>`: Another block-level container for grouping elements.
    - `<a href="http://www.instagram.com">Instagram</a>`: A hyperlink to Instagram.
    - `<a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>`: A hyperlink to Facebook.
